# Data Science :octopus:

This is an ongoing effort by me to create better visualizations in Plotly. I take on these projects as a precursor to machine learning. :computer: Well atleast that's what I tell myself!

## Getting Started

1. Open a ipynb for the data project that interests you
2. Code along!
 

Open http://localhost:3000 in the browser.

## Built With

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) - Or just go with anaconda
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Basic data mgt utility
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - Mathematical funcs for Python
